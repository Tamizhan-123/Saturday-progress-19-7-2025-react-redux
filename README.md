React Redux is a state management library. It helps manage and centralize the application state for large-scale React apps.
Redux follows a unidirectional data flow:

UI Component → calls → Action

Action → goes to → Reducer

Reducer → updates the Store

UI Component subscribes to the Store and re-renders
